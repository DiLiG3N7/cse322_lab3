		<h1>Youth</h1>
		<hr>
		<h2>Daughter, Matt Kearney, The 1975, Lorde, Eminem, and the Fray</h2>

		<p>We are the reckless, <br>we are the wild <b><i>youth</i></b>, 
		<br>Trying to find our way <br>down a road we don't know</p>
		<p>Chasing <b><i>dreams</i></b>, <br>man, it's harder than it seems 
		<br>How many of our parents seem to make it <br>anyway?</p>
		<p>Maybe the internet raised us, <br>or maybe people are jerks 
		<br>High off of <b><i>love</i></b>, drunk off of 
		<b><i>hate</i></b> <br>Just wasting time
		<br>trying to prove who's right <br>Can't we all just get along?</p>
